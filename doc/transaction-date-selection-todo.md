# Transaction Date Selection Feature - TODO

## Overview
Add transaction date selection functionality to all admin page forms to allow users to backdate transactions, particularly useful for accumulating sales over multiple days and entering them in batches.

## Requirements
- Add date input field to all 4 forms (Receiving, Transfer, Adjustment, Sales)
- Default all date inputs to today's date
- Allow users to select past dates for backdating transactions
- One date per batch (all records in a single submission use the same date)
- Backend already supports custom timestamps via `item.timestamp || new Date()`

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Receiving Form (Current) ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Add date input field to receiving form
- [x] Update `handleReceivingSubmit()` function to include timestamp
- [x] Add date initialization for receiving form
- [x] Fix form reset to maintain today's date after submission
- [x] Fix backend to use provided timestamp instead of current time
- [x] Fix date formatting in all sheets to DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS format
- [x] Test receiving form with custom dates

### Phase 2: Transfer Form ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Add date input field to transfer form
- [x] Update `handleTransferSubmit()` function to include timestamp
- [x] Update `clearTransferForm()` function to reset date to today
- [x] Update `initializeDateInputs()` function to include transfer form
- [x] Test transfer form with custom dates

### Phase 3: Adjustment Form ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Add date input field to adjustment form
- [x] Update `handleAdjustmentSubmit()` function to include timestamp
- [x] Update `clearAdjustmentForm()` function to reset date to today
- [x] Update `initializeDateInputs()` function to include adjustment form
- [x] Test adjustment form with custom dates

### Phase 4: Sales Form ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Add date input field to sales form
- [x] Update `handleSalesSubmit()` function to include timestamp
- [x] Update `clearSalesForm()` function to reset date to today
- [x] Update `initializeDateInputs()` function to include sales form
- [x] Test sales form with custom dates

### Phase 5: Final Testing
- [ ] Test all forms with various date scenarios
- [ ] Verify backend properly processes custom timestamps
- [ ] Verify calculated columns update correctly with backdated transactions
- [ ] Test edge cases (future dates, very old dates)

## Technical Details

### Frontend Changes Required
1. **HTML**: Add date input fields to all 4 forms
2. **JavaScript**: Update form submission functions to include timestamp
3. **Initialization**: Set default date to today for all forms

### Backend Changes Required
- **None** - Backend already supports custom timestamps via `item.timestamp || new Date()`

### Files to Modify
- `admin-page.html` - Add date inputs and update JavaScript functions
- No backend changes needed

## User Experience
- **Default behavior**: All date inputs show today's date
- **Backdating**: Users can select any past date for accumulated transactions
- **Batch processing**: All records in one submission use the same date
- **Multiple dates**: Users submit separate batches for different dates

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All 4 forms have date input fields
- [ ] All forms default to today's date
- [ ] All forms accept custom dates
- [ ] Backend processes custom timestamps correctly
- [ ] Calculated columns update properly with backdated transactions
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Estimated Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Receiving)**: 30 minutes
- **Phase 2 (Transfer)**: 30 minutes  
- **Phase 3 (Adjustment)**: 30 minutes
- **Phase 4 (Sales)**: 30 minutes
- **Phase 5 (Testing)**: 30 minutes
- **Total**: 2.5 hours

## Notes
- Backend already supports custom timestamps, making this primarily a frontend enhancement
- One date per batch simplifies the implementation
- Default to today provides good user experience
- Particularly useful for sales accumulation scenarios
