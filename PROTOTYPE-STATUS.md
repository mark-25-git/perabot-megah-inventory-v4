## 🎯 **CURRENT STATUS: WORKING PROTOTYPE** ✅

### **What We've Achieved**

#### **✅ Backend (Google Apps Script) - FULLY FUNCTIONAL**
- **All 4 operation modes** working correctly
- **Real-time inventory updates** with automatic snapshot maintenance
- **Comprehensive debug logging** system
- **Bulk data support** for efficient operations
- **Proper error handling** and validation
- **Negative adjustment support** for corrections

#### **✅ Frontend (MVP) - READY FOR TESTING**
- **Basic HTML interface** (`index.html`) for testing all operations
- **Real-time connection testing** and sheet validation
- **Debug log display** directly on webpage
- **Form validation** and user feedback
